I commited like this:

git commit -m "i add validation with @Valid annotation. performs validation of a User object against certain rules and constraints, which may be defined in the User class or in annotations applied to its fields."
git push origin master

Launch

1. Clone the repository using the command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twilight.git
    ```
2. Create a MySQL database and configure the connection in the `application.properties` file.
3. Use the development environment to run the application or run the Maven command:
    ```
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
4. Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8080` to access the application.



Additional Information

This project is being developed as part of the training. The design of the application has not yet been completed, but the functionality is almost implemented, but I think itâ€™s worth adding more functionality, but due to illness I did not have time to finish it. However, there are plans to add new features and improve the user interface in the near future.
